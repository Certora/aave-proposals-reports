### Technical analysis

We have verified that the payload correctly sets up the parameters for the asset. We have verified that the payload supplies the asset to the pool to avoid a first deposit attack. The use of the BTC/USD price feed (instead of tBTC/USD) is supported by the DAO as specified in the forum.

<br>

The proposal is consistent with the description on both Snapshot and the governance forum.
