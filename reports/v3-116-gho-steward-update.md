### Context

This proposal updates the Gho Steward to a more efficient version, which allows more granular control over Gho to increase itâ€™s efficiency. The new Steward will be able to update the GSM fee strategy by 50 bps both ways, update the borrow Cap in both ways and to update exposure Cap in both ways.

### Technical analysis

We have verified that the payload is setting the new Gho Steward as Risk admin over the facilitators of Gho and removes the old admin from being a pool admin over the facilitators of Gho.

<br>

The proposal is consistent with the description on the governance forum.
